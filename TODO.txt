===DONE===
2)allow changing of weight attribute(OK)
3)update all the maps when the graph is editted(DELETE DONE)(CREATE DONE)(SAVE DONE)
--node will only count if its created(createNEinNetwork)
9)clear the nodes and edge properly(DONE)
--somewhere there is a bug(DONE)
11)bug when changing from directed to undirected graph(DONE)
7) find a way to display the distance(DONE)
--allow choosing of 2 nodes(OK)
--hold ctrl(OK)
--left on how to display the distance and path to take(OK)
--how to determine which edge to use?(OK)
12)add rid as 1 of the labels(DONE)
13)add color code for edges(OK)
-add in network details(DONE)
--num of node/edge(DONE)
--gamma(DONE)
--add avg into the graphs(degree/CC)(DONE)
-change to appropriate tabs when clicking stuff(nodes/edge)(OK)
-load the V/E schema from the start and load it when u clear the graph as well(OK)
-do something about the create/delete nodes/edge(OK)

===NOT DONE===

===DO NOW===
5)add plotting graphs to the functionailities
--degree distribution(DONE)
--CC distribution(DONE)
--add in Random Network/Scale Free Network distribution
--may need to transfer the computing to the server
6)add network properties
--will only be computed when needed
--add in a computing screen
--may need to transfer the computing to the server
14)increase size of node according to degree/closeness/betweenness/CC(DONE)
16)update weight of affected nodes
===DO LATER===
1)find better layouts to display graphs properly
--add options to change types of layouts
--optimize displaying
4)find common json formats of existing graph to be supported by the upload function
--done 1(show prof to cfm which to do)
---1.Support all format
---2.Make the user follow my format
15)do something about the export network

=== may not need to do ===
8) add undo(SEE HOW)
